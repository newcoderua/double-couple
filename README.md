Fot this app I am gonna use OTP - one time password.

for generating code and saving code and backend -> we gonna use firebase. For texting message to user, we are going to use twilio

Basically, Firebase is a place to store json data.

To do comparing stuff on the server - we want to use Google Cloud Functions, since firebase does not do any processing, it just stores JSON data.
If you like AWS, you might want to use AWS lambda instead.

to use firebase command line tools -> npm install -g firebase-tools
